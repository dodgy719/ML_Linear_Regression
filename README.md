# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms. It is used widely for its ease of implementation and its very easy interpretability. Here we are trying to get a grasp of some of the basic concepts behind simple and multiple regression and are trying to implement them using python. We will be using the famous auto_mpg dataset for doing this. Further steps that are not covered here are include model validation of linear regression and calculation of the error.
